# Handwritten Character Recognition with CNN

## Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing handwritten characters from images. The model is designed to accept an image of a handwritten character as input and predict the corresponding character through a series of processing layers. By leveraging a large dataset of handwritten characters, this neural network learns essential patterns and features characteristic of various handwriting styles.

## Features

- Utilizes a CNN architecture optimized for image recognition tasks
- Processes images through multiple convolutional and pooling layers to extract relevant features
- Employs fully connected layers for accurate character prediction
- Outputs a probability distribution for character recognition using softmax activation
- Trained using categorical cross-entropy loss function and optimized via backpropagation

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- A machine with a GPU is recommended for faster training

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Mahdi-hasan-shuvo/Handwriting-Recognition.git
   cd Handwriting-Recognition
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset

The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset of handwritten characters. You can use the [EMNIST dataset](https://www.nist.gov/itl/products-and-services/emnist-dataset-0) or any other relevant dataset suitable for handwritten character recognition.

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset by placing your images in the designated directory.
2. Update the configuration file with your dataset path and training parameters.
3. Train the model by executing the following command:
   ```
   python train.py
   ```

4. To evaluate the model on test data, run:
   ```
   python evaluate.py
   ```

5. To make predictions on new images, use:
   ```
   python predict.py --image path/to/your/image.png
   ```

## Model Architecture

- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract feature maps using various filters to detect edges, corners, and patterns.
- **Pooling Layers**: Downsample feature maps to reduce dimensionality and computational load.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Combine the features to form predictions about the character.
- **Output Layer**: Uses softmax activation to provide a probability distribution across possible character classes.

## Training

The model employs the categorical cross-entropy loss function to evaluate prediction accuracy. During training, the weights are adjusted using backpropagation, ensuring optimal performance on unseen data.

## Applications

- Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- Signature Verification
- Automated Form Processing
- Educational Tools for Handwriting Analysis
