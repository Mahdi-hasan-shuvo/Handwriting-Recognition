# Handwritten Character Recognition with CNN

## Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing handwritten characters from images. The model is designed to accept an image of a handwritten character as input and predict the corresponding character through a series of processing layers. By leveraging a large dataset of handwritten characters, this neural network learns essential patterns and features characteristic of various handwriting styles.

## Features

- Utilizes a CNN architecture optimized for image recognition tasks
- Processes images through multiple convolutional and pooling layers to extract relevant features
- Employs fully connected layers for accurate character prediction
- Outputs a probability distribution for character recognition using softmax activation
- Trained using categorical cross-entropy loss function and optimized via backpropagation

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- A machine with a GPU is recommended for faster training

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Mahdi-hasan-shuvo/Handwriting-Recognition.git
   cd Handwriting-Recognition
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset

The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset of handwritten characters. You can use the [EMNIST dataset](https://www.nist.gov/itl/products-and-services/emnist-dataset-0) or any other relevant dataset suitable for handwritten character recognition.

## Usage


1 To make predictions on new images, use:
   ```
   #image = cv2.imread('your image_path')
   python test.py
   ```

## Model Architecture

- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract feature maps using various filters to detect edges, corners, and patterns.
- **Pooling Layers**: Downsample feature maps to reduce dimensionality and computational load.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Combine the features to form predictions about the character.
- **Output Layer**: Uses softmax activation to provide a probability distribution across possible character classes.

## Training

The model employs the categorical cross-entropy loss function to evaluate prediction accuracy. During training, the weights are adjusted using backpropagation, ensuring optimal performance on unseen data.

## Applications

- Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- Signature Verification
- Automated Form Processing
- Educational Tools for Handwriting Analysis
